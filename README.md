## _My portfolio website_


To create my portfolio website I start to follow the guide to create site on GitHub [here](https://docs.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages/creating-a-github-pages-site).
## Html base template
At the [link](https://www.free-css.com/)  you can find just two template for all type of site you want. 

These are the steps I performed:

- Change all reference to external link or different person;
- Change photo and all you don’t want on your site;
- Create on GitHub all repository for the site, I don’t use google drive to have in one place all my portfolio and the GitHub repositories have everything you need to show correctly all type of code;
- For the LinkedIn and  GitHub bottoms there are many examples on the internet, but to choose the correct position and colour, being my first project in html, it was hard.

The contact me section was the hardest part. 

Remain between us, but there is still a problem with confirming the submission of the form that I cannot get past.
## Google Form for feedback

For collect the submission I follow thise [guide](https://github.com/toperkin/staticFormEmails#step-5---add-some-javascript-to-keep-track-of-what-happens-after-a-submit) that permit to save all data on google forms.

At the beginning I made a notification for all new modify at the google sheet, but for receive the message on my Gmail address is necessary create a google script embedded on google form.

If you want  you can fallow the [folder](https://github.com/Gabriele-Simonetta/gabriele-simonetta.github.io/tree/main/form%20google) to see the google script and the html email.
The script create on google form, _NB not in the connected sheet_, necessity the google permission for send email as you and the activation trigger for the function “sendEmail”.
Inshort words the script copy the message that arrived from the form and send an email to you, as the guest send a direct email. 
The good point is that all are free and on your “roof”.
In the repository google form there are alse twp html template for the email: Italian version and English version.
